### What is Permissions Management? 
Microsoft Entra Permissions Management (MEPM) is a cloud infrastructure entitlement management (CIEM) solution that provides comprehensive visibility into permissions assigned to all identities including both workload and user identities, actions, and resources across multi-cloud infrastructures in *Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Google Cloud Platform (GCP)*. Permissions Management detects, automatically right-sizes, and continuously monitors unused and excessive permissions.

Permissions Management helps your organization tackle cloud permissions by enabling the capabilities to continuously discover, remediate and monitor the activity of every unique user and workload identity operating in the cloud, alerting security and infrastructure teams to areas of unexpected or excessive risk. 
- Get granular cross-cloud visibility - Get a comprehensive view of every action performed by any identity on any resource.
- Enforce least privilege - Right-size permissions based on usage and activity and enforce permissions on-demand at cloud scale.
- Uncover permission risk - Assess permission risk by evaluating the gap between permissions granted and permissions used.
- Monitor and detect anomalies - Detect anomalous permission usage and generate detailed forensic reports.
